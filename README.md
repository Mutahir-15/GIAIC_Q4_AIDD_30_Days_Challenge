**AIDD (AI-Driven Development) – 30 Days Challenge**
====================================================

Welcome to my **30-Days AI-Driven Development Challenge**!This repository contains **15 structured tasks**, each published **every 48 hours**, to document my learning journey with:

*   **AIDD – AI-Driven Development**
    
*   **Gemini CLI**
    
*   **Claude CLI**
    
*   **Spec-Kit-Plus**
    
*   **PDF Summarization Agents**
    
*   **Automation Tools**
