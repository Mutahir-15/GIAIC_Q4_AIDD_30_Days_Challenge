🧮 AIDD – Task 08
=================

### **Simple Calculator using SpecKitPlus (All 5 Phases)**

**AI-Driven Development — 30-Day Challenge**

This repository contains my official submission for **Task 08** of the AIDD 30-Day Challenge.The goal was to build a **Simple Calculator** using **SpecKitPlus**, completing all **five structured phases** of specification-driven development.

🚀 **Task Objective**
---------------------

Create a **calculator** using **SpecKitPlus**, following the complete AI-Driven Development workflow:

### ✔ 1️⃣ Constitution Phase

Define the project foundation, purpose, and high-level direction.

### ✔ 2️⃣ Specify Phase

Write clear specifications, inputs, outputs, constraints, and features.

### ✔ 3️⃣ Plan Phase

Break down the specification into actionable implementation steps.

### ✔ 4️⃣ Tasks Phase

Generate atomic tasks and workflows using the SpecKitPlus task manager.

### ✔ 5️⃣ Implement Phase

Execute tasks and generate the final working calculator.

🧠 **Tech Used**
----------------

*   **SpecKitPlus** (specification-driven AGI workflow)
    
*   **Gemini CLI**
    
*   **Python** (for the calculator logic)
    
*   **Markdown** for documentation
    
*   **Terminal-based testing**
    

🎯 **Purpose of This Task**
---------------------------

This assignment helped in understanding:

*   How to break down a project using **AIDD + SpecKitPlus**
    
*   How autonomous tasks are generated through structured specification
    
*   How AI agents collaborate with developers in a real workflow
    
*   How SDD (Specification-Driven Development) improves clarity and reduces errors
    

⭐ Final Thoughts
----------------

This task was an amazing hands-on experience to learn **how AI Agents can become coding partners** when paired with **SpecKitPlus**.It shows how powerful structured development becomes when AI performs the heavy lifting and we focus on system thinking.
