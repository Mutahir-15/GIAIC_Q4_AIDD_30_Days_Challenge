## Core Principles

### I. Clean and Readable Code
The code should be written in a way that is easy to understand and maintain. This includes using meaningful variable names, clear function definitions, and adhering to a consistent coding style.

### II. User-Friendly UI
The user interface should be intuitive and easy to use for non-technical users. The layout should be simple and the interactions straightforward.

### III. Well-Commented Code
Comments should be used to explain complex logic, assumptions, and the purpose of different parts of the code. This helps other developers (and future you) to understand the code better.

## Governance
All pull requests and reviews must verify compliance with these principles. Any deviation must be justified.
